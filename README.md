# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

- Plans for next steps:
    - Find a better video to loop on the main page
    - Not as important:
        - Add more modules to the timeline
        - Make it so that the timeline can grow by itself and is not dependent on percentages to be on the page
        - Make the subscribe button work 
            - Template: https://codepen.io/marcobiedermann/pen/dsbFy
        - Prevent the page from continously scrolling
        - Count views per page
        - Make a like button on the home page
        - The Sign Up doesn't shrink from the navbar (but it's not a bad thing because it makes it easier to access)
        - Add light/dark mode
        - Add sound button (so cute)
            - Template: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/latest/
    - Important:
        - Build the blog page
            - Template: https://codepen.io/selcukcura/pen/MORaZJ
            - Template: https://blog.maximeheckel.com/
        - Build post layouts:
            - Template: https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/pen/OJyPygv
            - Template: https://codepen.io/laviperchik/pen/PBYLZw
        - Build a project page
            - Template: https://codepen.io/ethanthompson/pen/ogbebL
        - Build activities page -> Possibly convert to a gallery for my artwork
            - https://codepen.io/web-tiki/pen/HhCyd
            - Make it so that when an image is clicked, it pops up and fills the entire page

        - Build certifications page

    - Miscallenous ideas:
        - Get length/width of page
            - Draw line under the title
        - For blog: Put title cooking  
            - Write a blog about getting rid of calcium residue
            - Write a blog about making egg tarts
            - Write a blog about making bubble tea
        - In the future make the blog so that it can be filtered by date (similar idea can be applied to certificates and projects):
            - By popularity
            - By likes
            - By comments
            - By genre
